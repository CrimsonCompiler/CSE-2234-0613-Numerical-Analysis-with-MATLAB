# Variables in Matlab ( Though I am doing this on octave )

# Syntax

# [variable_name] = [expression]

a = 2 # automatic result

a = 3; # no - automatic result
a

b = (1 + 3) / 2

# assigning values
c = b # c is 2 here
c = 5 # value changes here

d = b + 1


a = a + 1 # updating the variable a with recursively


# check what variables used
who

# more details
whos

# delete a variable
clear a b

# delete all
clear all


# Variable naming convention

# 1abc = 10 x
# a!bcs = 20 x
# a bc = 5 x

abc = 10

# case sensitive
Abc = 20


# Text variable
str = 'Tousif'
